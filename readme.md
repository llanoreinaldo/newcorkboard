## <a name="Product"></a>About Our Product</center>

#### Purpose
Cork Board is an easy to use dynamic web application that allows you to create and bookmark a unique board space and invite anyone to read and post to your board. On your board, you can bookmark, tag, and search for your favorite links. You can also add announcements to communicate with your board followers.

It's our hope that through our app you can better pool resources with teammates, friends, and classmates as you work together. The Cork Board app allows a team/group/class to have a bulletin board site to share messages and resource links.

Cork Board allow users to create a project board for announcements and bookmarks to helpful articles/websites, bookmarks will have a description, url, and topic.

On hitting the home page for the app, users will be able to create a project board. Then they will get a url back that is a link to their new project page. On the project page any user that has that url will be able to add messages or resources to the board. After board creation, Cork Board asks for users to invite by email, then after entering email addresses, app sends invitation email to users

Once a board is created, users have the ability to create tags and add bookmarks.

Multiple tags can be assigned to each item bookmarked to make searching easier, allowing users to show all resources by tag/topic.

So if a user clicks or asks for "Javascript", they will get every resource that has a "Javascript" tag.
